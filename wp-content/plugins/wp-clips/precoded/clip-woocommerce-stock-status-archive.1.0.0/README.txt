This Clip adds the stock status to WooCommerce shop and archive Pages for both simple and variable products.


REQUIREMENTS

1.  WP Clips Plus or Multisite (plugin by Krolyn Studios)
2.  WooCommerce v2.5+ (by WooThemes)


INSTALLING THE CLIP

Important! Always remember to back-up your site before making any changes. And NEVER replace the /wp-clips/ plugin folder as this will overwrite your custom Clip folder and delete any Precoded Clips.

When you are ready to install -

Go to ‘Settings > Clips’ in WordPress admin and install via ‘WP Clips Control’; OR unzip and upload via FTP (or file manager) to the /wp-clips/precoded/ directory.


USING THE CLIP

Stock management must be enabled for the stock status to appear. For variable products, stock management must be enabled at product level or for ‘all’ variations.

One of five messages will appear -

1.  In stock - appears when an item or all variations of an item are in stock.
2.  In stock (some items) - appears on variable products where only some items are in stock and remaining items are either available on backorder or out of stock.
3.  Available on backorder - appears when an item or all variations of an item are available on backorder.
4.  Available on backorder (some items) - appears on variable products where only some items are available on backorder and remaining items are out of stock.
5.  Out of stock - appears when an item or all variations of an item are out of stock.

Styling -

The stock status is currently styled with basic WooCommerce properties. However, custom CSS can be added to your custom Clip's ‘custom-style.css’ file to achieve desired results.


NOTES

This Clip supports simple and variable products only.
