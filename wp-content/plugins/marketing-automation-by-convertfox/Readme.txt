Use ConvertFox Event Visualizer to track particular visitor actions, such as visiting a page on your website, clicking a link in an email, making a purchase, or any other custom event you define on ConvertFox. We support an unlimited number of events.

Create custom high converting forms without touching code. Choose the type of opt-in forms you would like to display, choose which pages they should be displayed on and choose what user actions should trigger these forms.
